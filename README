SPELL: spellchecking library for Common Lisp.

License: BSD

Loading the SPELL system may initially take up to 20 seconds (on my machine) as
an English dictionary is loaded and compiled into the resulting FASL file.

For loading the full version:
> (ql:quickload :spell)

Currently the only exported functions are #'ENGLISH-LOOKUP that accepts a
string, and #'ENGLISH-CHECK-PARAGRAPH that checks a whole paragraph of text and
returns a list of conses. Each cons represents a single word in the paragraph
which has failed dictionary lookup, with the CAR and CDR being offsets in the
original string outlining the word.

SPELL> (english-lookup "horse")
(#<VERB {1007FD1FF3}> #<NOUN {1007FD2043}>)
SPELL> (english-check-paragraph "In Polish, a horse is koÅ„, and in German, it's
das Pferd.")
((22 . 25) (47 . 50) (51 . 56))

Backward Compatibility Notice

The Spell library provides the spell/simple ASDF system. The
difference between the full and the simple version used to be that the
simple version answered only "does this word occur in the English
dictionary?" with a boolean value, while the full version returns a
list of all word meanings associated with that string. However, this
difference no longer exists and the spell/simple system is now an
alias for the spell system.

The spell/simple system can still be loaded with:
> (ql:quickload :spell/simple)
